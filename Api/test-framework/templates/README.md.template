# TEMPLATE_MODULE API Tests

This directory contains unit tests for the TEMPLATE_MODULE API. The tests use the CMocka unit testing framework to verify the API's functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, you need to install the CMocka testing framework:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libcmocka-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install libcmocka-devel

# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install cmocka
```

## Building and Running Tests

To build and run the tests:

```bash
# Build the tests
make

# Run the tests
make run

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Run tests with code coverage
make coverage
```

## Test Structure

- `test_*.c`: Main test file containing test cases for the API
- `mock_*.h/c`: Mock implementation of the external interfaces used by the API
- `Makefile`: Build configuration for the tests

## Test Coverage

To generate code coverage reports, run:

```bash
make coverage
```

This will create `.gcov` files showing line-by-line coverage of the source code.

## Adding New Tests

To add new tests:

1. Add new test functions in the test file following the existing pattern
2. Add the new test functions to the `tests` array in the `main()` function
3. Run the tests to verify your changes
